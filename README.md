# Machine Learning Portfolio

This project contains Machine Learning projects to do with multiple different topics spaning a wide variety of areas. Multiple different techniques are used including linear regression and K-Means Clustering with comments to outline the benefits of each algorithm.


## Included Projects

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a simple yet important form of regression. Linear regression works by fitting a linear line to data points which minimises the difference between predicted and actual values.

### K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
KNN clusters data into groups based on the nearest neighbors. This is an effective way of classifying different kind of data when given the data but not the correct ouputs.

### K-Means Clustering
K-Means Clustering groups data points based on similarities between them.
