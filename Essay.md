# A Guide to Machine Learning: Understanding the Fundamentals and Techniques

## Introduction
Machine learning has recently emerged as a profound technology that has major impacts across many different fields. The remarkable advancements made through machine learning in areas such as healthcare, self-driving cars and personal assistants have led to massive leaps in the technological landscape. However, much of the artificial intelligence industry and the different models used remain a mystery which can cause distrust in the technology. This essay will provide a brief overview of some of the major fundamentals and techniques used in machine learning today and how these apply to the real world.

## Overview of Machine Learning
Traditional algorithms have been given the rules to apply to a set of inputs to produce an output. This method requires the programmer to know every rule and to ensure that the inputs will never be outside the rules. Machine learning works by providing the algorithm with inputs and outputs and it figures out the rules. Machine learning is then able to learn and apply these rules to sets of data that were never programmed in the original. It can therefore make predictions on new data or even generate content based on these rules. 

## Types of Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning
In this type of learning the algorithm is given a labelled dataset meaning the correct output is provided. The algorithm can then learn and connect inputs to outputs and predict new data. This method of learning can be used for many types of pattern recognition.

### Unsupervised Learning
This approach for learning provides the algorithm with unlabelled data, it doesnâ€™t have the correct answers. The algorithm then is able to group or cluster data and is then able to group new data therefore making predictions. This can be used in the medical field as it is very accurate at clustering similar inputs.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement algorithms train by rewarding desirable outcomes and penalising undesirable actions. This is similar to the way humans and animals learn. For instance getting a good mark on an assignment is a reward for doing the right thing and a bad mark encourages you to change your behaviour. 

## Preprocessing
Before training any machine learning algorithm it is vital to preprocess the data. Preprocessing involves:
- Cleaning
  - Cleaning the data means removing bad data that could influence the results in a negative way
- Transforming
  - Handling missing values. This could be for a number of reasons but often there are missing values and handling these gaps is vital for an algorithm to be accurate.
  - Scaling data. Often algorithms work best when the variables or inputs are on a similar scale. This can mean transforming the data into a scale between 1 to 10 for instance.
  - Transforming to numerical values. Datasets can often include variables that are not numerical such as colour. These need to be changed to a numerical value for the algorithm to be able to perform calculations using them.
- Organising
  - Removing duplicates is vital to remove bias from the result and ensures the dataset represents the underlying information.
  - Outliers can distort the modelling and therefore need to be accounted for.

## Techniques
### Regression
There are many types of regression however they all follow similar principles. Regression algorithms aim to predict outputs directly based on the input. Linear Regression is a simple yet important form of regression. Linear regression works by fitting a linear line to data points which minimises the difference between predicted and actual values. Polynomial regression is a more complex type of regression that is more suitable when the relationship between inputs and outputs is not linear. 

### Clustering
Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning which groups similar data points together. This technique can discover trends or patterns in data where labels are not available. A common type of clustering is K-Means Clustering, this method organises the data based on the locations of other data points.

###Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural Language Processing has received a lot of attention recently with large language models such as GPT-4 becoming accessible to more people. NLP can understand, interpret and generate language similar to that of a human. 

## Training and Evaluation
When creating a machine learning algorithm it is important to have two datasets, one for training and one for testing. The training dataset needs to be as accurate as possible and this is what the model is trained on. The testing model can then be used to identify whether the algorithm is capable of accurate prediction. Measuring the performance of the model is important for identifying issues and solving problems. 

## Conclusion
Machine learning can provide many uses in many different circumstances. The field of artificial intelligence has endless possibilities and this essay has gone over some of the basic types, techniques and applications of machine learning.
